# CSS Makeovers

This repo contains the standalone examples from [cssmakeovers.com](https://www.cssmakeovers.com/), a site designed to help you discover new layout possibilities, and learn from popular sites and common layout patterns redone with Grid and Flexbox.

**Note:** The site is not deployed from this repo, so although I really appreciate the sentiment of submitting a pull request, please hold off from doing so. Thank you!
